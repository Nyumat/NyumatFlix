# Code of Conduct

This document outlines some of the rules and guidelines for contributing to this project.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in the project a harassment-free and inclusive experience for everyone. We are committed to ensuring that all members of the project's community, regardless of age, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation, feel welcome and respected.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that helps create a positive community for the project include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language in code, discussions, and contributions
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences about the project, media, and technology
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism related to the project
* Focusing on what is best for the project's community
* Showing empathy towards other contributors and users

Examples of unacceptable behavior by members of the project's community include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or open source community setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful to the project.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of the project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project's community through appropriate channels.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project's community is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's community.
