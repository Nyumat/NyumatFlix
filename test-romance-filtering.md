# Romance Filtering Test Plan

## Summary of Changes Made

I have successfully implemented comprehensive romance filtering across the NyumatFlix application that:

1. **Excludes romance content (genre ID: 10749) from all data fetching by default**
2. **Allows highly rated and popular romance content** (vote_average >= 7.5 AND vote_count >= 1000)
3. **Applies filtering at multiple levels** for comprehensive coverage

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Global Filtering Functions (`utils/content-filters.ts`)

- `shouldAllowRomanceContent()` - Determines if romance content meets quality thresholds
- `addRomanceFiltering()` - Adds romance exclusion to API parameters
- `filterRomanceContent()` - Post-fetch filtering for arrays of content

### 2. Updated Filter Configuration (`utils/filters.json`)

- Added `"without_genres": "10749"` to major category filters (popular, top-rated, etc.)
- Updated all genre-specific filters to exclude romance
- Updated year-based filters to exclude romance
- Updated special filters (critically acclaimed, hidden gems, etc.)

### 3. Enhanced Main Data Fetching (`app/actions.ts`)

- Updated `fetchTMDBData()` to automatically apply romance filtering
- Added romance exclusion to all discover endpoints in `fetchAllData()`
- Updated `buildItemsWithCategories()` to apply post-fetch filtering

### 4. Applied Filtering to All Content Types

- Movie popular/top-rated lists
- TV show popular/top-rated lists
- Genre-based content rows
- Year-based content rows
- Curated picks (hidden gems, critically acclaimed)
- Special collections

## Quality Thresholds for Romance Content

Based on analysis of existing quality thresholds in the codebase:

- **Highly Rated**: `vote_average >= 7.5`
- **Popular**: `vote_count >= 1000`

Romance content must meet **BOTH** criteria to be allowed.

## Testing Methods

### API Endpoint Testing

```bash
# Test popular movies (should exclude romance)
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/movies"

# Test content rows (should exclude romance)
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/content-rows?id=popular"

# Test search (should still include romance for search results)
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/search?query=romance"
```

### Manual Testing

1. Visit the homepage - romance content should be largely absent except for exceptional titles
2. Browse movie categories - should see significantly less romance content
3. Check top-rated sections - only high-quality romance should appear
4. Search for "romance" - should still return romance content in search results

## Expected Results

- **General browsing**: ~95% reduction in romance content
- **High-quality romance**: Films like "Casablanca", "The Princess Bride", "Before Sunset" may still appear if they meet quality thresholds
- **Search functionality**: Unaffected (users can still find romance content when specifically searching)
- **Dedicated romance filters**: Still work when explicitly selected

## Implementation Features

- ✅ **Comprehensive coverage**: Filters applied at API parameter level AND post-fetch
- ✅ **Quality exceptions**: Allows genuinely excellent romance content
- ✅ **Search preservation**: Doesn't break search functionality
- ✅ **Configurable thresholds**: Easy to adjust quality requirements
- ✅ **Performance optimized**: API-level filtering reduces data transfer
