## Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request, please ensure that:

1. All tests pass.
2. All build and lint checks pass.
3. If required, update the `README.md` and other documentation to reflect the changes.
4. Add screenshots or other relevant media to the pull request description.

## Issues

When creating an issue, please try and be as detailed as possible. Be sure to include any relevant error messages, reproduction steps, and really think about the impact of the issue.

This helps the maintainers and possible contributors to understand the issue and work towards a solution as soon as possible.

### Issue Labels

When creating an issue, please use the labels feature to add the appropriate labels to the issue, so scanning the issues is easier and more efficient for the maintainers.

## Contributing to the Codebase

Most of the codebase is written in TypeScript, so please ensure that your changes are in line with the project's TypeScript configuration. This is probably the most important thing to consider when contributing to the codebase.

For everything else, the `README.md` file is a good place to start. If there's something you're not sure about, feel free to ask in the issues section. This could be a good opportunity to contribute to the project by making documentation for contributors better!
