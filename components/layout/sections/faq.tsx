      "We do not host any content on our servers. We only provide links to third-party websites such as 2embed, etc. These third parties often inject scripts into their iframes (the elements that play the movies/tv shows) - to display ads. We recommend using an adblocker to block these ads - as Nyumatflix itself is ad-free!",
