## 🏃🏾‍♂️ Run NyumatFlix Locally 🏃🏾‍♂️

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nyumat/NyumatFlix.git
```

2. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

```bash
# The API key for The Movie Database (TMDb)
API_KEY=
# First is for movies, second one is for TV shows. Both are required.
NYUMATFLIX_VPS=
NYUMATFLIX_VPS2=
```

I purposely left the API key blank so that you can get your own. You can get one by creating an account on [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/). For the other two variables, you can get them by checking out [FMHY](https://fmhy.net/).

3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
