## üèÉüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run NyumatFlix Locally

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Prerequisites:
>
> - [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your machine.
> - A [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.
> - A [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API key.
> - A [Resend](https://resend.com/) API key.
> - A [GitHub OAuth App](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app) created.

To run the project on your machine, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nyumat/NyumatFlix.git
cd NyumatFlix
```

2. Next, create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

```bash
TMDB_API_KEY=
AUTH_RESEND_KEY=
AUTH_URL=
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
PROD_DATABASE_URL=
DATABASE_URL=
```

> [!WARNING]
> NyumatFlix won't work without these environment variables. You can remove them, but please note, you will **lose anything related to database access**.

3. Install dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

4. Configure magic strings

There's a few places in the codebase where I'm hardcoding some strings that you might want to change. You can find some of them in `lib/constants.ts`. Additionally, you might want to modify the email templates in `emails/` and `metadata` objects in `app/` and `layout/`.

If you end up not changing the magic strings, that's fine too, but I'd appreciate credit if you use NyumatFlix without modifications. [License](LICENSE)

5. Set up the database

```bash
bun run db:generate
bun run db:push
bun run db:studio # optional
```

This will generate the necessary migration files and push the schema to your PostgreSQL database. You can also use `bun run db:studio` to open Drizzle's database studio to visualize the DB internals.

6. Run the development server

```bash
bun run dev
```

7. Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see NyumatFlix in action!

## ü§ùüèø Contributing

Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are always welcome. If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue. I can't guarantee I'll be able to address everything as a solo dev (on top of juggling other commitments), but I'll do my best!

## üôèüèø Support the project

If you find NyumatFlix useful, consider [buying me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/nyumat) or starring the repo. Lastly, since I know there's a ton of people skidding this repo, please at least mention me as the original pioneer. Thanks!
